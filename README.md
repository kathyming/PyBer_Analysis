## Results

The overall analysis shows the following:
* Rural cities have fewer rides and drivers, but higher fares and fares per driver compared to urban and suburban cities.
* The average fare per driver in urban cities was $0.67 and the average fare was $24.53.
* The average fare per driver in suburban cities was $2.26 and the average fare was $30.97.
* The average fare per driver in rural cities was $8.06 and the average fare was $34.62.

The analysis by week shows the following:
* The number of rides across all city types increased at the end of Frebruary.
* Urban areas consistenlty have the highest amount of fares.
* Rural areas consistenly have the lowest amount of fares.

## Summary
Based on the results of the PyBer weekly fares by city type, I would reccommend the following for PyBer to increase income:
* Based on the low fares per driver numbers, it is evident there are many drivers enrolled who are not actually supplying rides.  Cleaning the data to remove drivers form the city driver counts who are not actually collecting fares/not driving would help bring better understanding to the data.
* Assuming enrolling drivers and maintaining their contracts impacts PyBer negatively in the form of administative costs, I would recommend to either reomving drivers without any fares from the circulation or implement an incentive to get them accepting rides.
* Rural rides are not as frequent but routinely bring higher fares.  Increasing rural ridership would bring PyBer more income per ride.
* Based on the high volume of rides in urban cities, by raising fares just a small amount PyBer could see the biggest impact to profit.
